PROBLEM STATEMENT : Though there exists a technology for face recognition based authentication, dynamic human recognition based authentication is highly challenging. For a given entrance gate a hardware-software solution is needed to identify every unique person who enters or exit the gate, with log of all previous entry/exit time, photo/videos recorded. That means there will not be a previous history of an individual on the first entry. The system should immediately alert the security if it is a new person and the security will decide to allow/restrict that person entering inside the premises. Whereas, the system should learn from its previous history of videos/images dynamically to allow a known person. For a given size of the gate, the number of cameras with optimal resolution required is also to be worked out as part of solution. The solution should be scalable and preferably based open source.

SOLUTION : The basic idea is keeping records, maintaining logs (Data, Time, Photos, Videos), and authentication of persons entering inside the premise using a dynamic human recognition application which uses AI and input from high resolution cameras such as face, height, human gestures, hairs, voice. The application can allow / deny the person who have previous stored history in the records with complete entry / exit time, photo, and video. If a new person with no previous stored history in the database tries to enter the premise, it is alerted to security, and then the security decides to allow the person or not. The application learns from the allowances or denies to the person by the security and then itself becomes capable of taking the decision.
